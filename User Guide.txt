Running the program in both release and debug will start the ray intersection function.

The object will be rendered to the screen and the time taken will be displayed within the console.

After 10 loops of the intersection function, an average of the previous 10 times will be displayed on the console.

A text file will the store all intersection points of the object with a number representing the which iteration of the object the file is storing with the name of the object at the top of the file.

All objects used for testing can be found in the Objects folder

In order to change the object being tested, navigate to the GameObject.cpp within visual Studio and locate the variable m_filename. Change the value of this variable to the name of the object you wish to test on and then compile the program with the object file within the program folder.
